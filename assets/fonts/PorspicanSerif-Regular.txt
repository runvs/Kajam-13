This new version 007.16 includes Cyrillic and additional accented Latin characters, and 
the kerning was reworked. Some characters (such as E, R) have cleaner curves, and a few 
characters that I had to redesign for Cyrillic (such as the м that must not look like 
the m, the н that must not look like the h) are also available as opentype alternate 
latin characters.
